# chessJs
HTML/CSS/Js chess game

a lightweight game of chess in your browser with no dependenices.
it feels reasonably fast and the four main files come in at under 25Kb

## to Use
open the jsChessBoard.html file in your browser 

or navigate to [toutcoule.net/demo/chessJs.html](https://toutcoule.net/demo/chessJs.html)

### working:
- valid move checker, check checker, mate checker, board rotate

## still lacking: 
- move history
- en passant capture
- pawn promotion

### future features: 
- viewable, traversable move history
- valid move highlighter
- better move highlighting
- threat indicator for check/escape hints

### thanks
please report bugs!!!

cheers,
