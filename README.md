or download the chessjs folder. You can then run the latest version from the command line with NodeJs vel. sim.

###### projects/plans :

id like to build an html css interface and create a working open source 2player chess game online that would be nice 
especially on tablets or phones, so you could go to a site and just start playing. 
additionally, the plan is to use pkg to wrap this into a terminal based ches program for 1 or possibly 2 players

additionally in the future ill try to creat a simple ai, or possibly merge an open source engine like stockfish into the project
