javascript chess

this package contains several elemental building blocks for a js chess game/engine, 
including a check checker, and a mate checker. 
as part of the mate check there is a rough version of a valid move checker. 

id like to build an html css interface and create a working open source 2player chess game online that would be nice 
especially on tablets or phones, so you could go to a site and just start playing. 

additionally in the future ill try to creat a simple ai, or possibly merge an open source engine like stockfish into the project
